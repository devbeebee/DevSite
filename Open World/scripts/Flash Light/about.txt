[head3]How to make a Flash Light in Unity3D with C#[/head3]   
[p]
To make a Flash light in Unity3D its rather simple all you need to do is reference a Light and set it enabled or not and to do this 
all you need to do is use enabled = !enabled on a key press so if the light is on it will turn off and vice versa.
